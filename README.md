## Supercollider Patch for Alvin Lucier's _Music for Piano with Slow Sweep Pure Wave Oscillators_(1992)

<br>
From the original score:

### <u>Description</u>

    Two pure wave oscillators slowly sweep around a central tone. As they do so, the pianist plays single tones and intervals against them, causing audible beats to sound at speeds determined by the distances between the piano sounds and those of the sweeping oscillators. The farther apart, the faster the beating. At unison, no beating occurs. Under certain acoustical conditions, the beating may be heard to spin through space.

### <u>Oscillators</u>

    The oscillator sweeps are recorded on DAT tape: Oscillator 1, left channel; Oscillator 2, right. There is a IO-second fade-in before the tones begin to sweep.

    Oscillator 1 rises from E4 to E6 at 18'' per semitone, descending back to E4 at 22". Oscillator 2 descends from E4 to E2 at 22", ascending at 18." The sweeps are notated by gradually rising and descending lines interrupted by chromatic pitches with black note-heads.

### <u>Piano</u>

    The piano should be positioned between the loudspeakers. 
    
    The pianist plays a series of tones chosen to produce audible beating with the sweeping oscillator pitches. Because of their overtone structure, piano tones which cause vivid beating may be in unison with, an octave below, or a 12th below any oscillator pitch. Each tone occurs twice in succession: 1) halfway between, ie., 9'' or 11'' before, two oscillator pitches, and 2) simultaneously with one, sometimes two, oscillator pitches (when the sweeps coincide).

    Tones played simultaneously with oscillator pitches produce beating patterns which start at zero (unison) and accelerate, as the pure wave sweeps away from them (and as 'long as the piano tone sounds.) Those played before the oscillator pitches produce patterns which start at various speeds, depending on the frequency of the pure wave, and decelerate to zero, as unison approaches.
    
    The pianist may regard the placement of the piano tones more as suggestions than exact timings. Accordingly, she should feel free to shift the pitches slightly forward and backward in time, roughly maintaining, however j the relationships between each other. To help her in her decisions, no timings have been given; rather she may listen to the sweeping pure waves and decide for herself when the tones should be played. Dynamics should be low and balanced with the sweeping pure tones, to achieve optimal beating.Pedal down throughout.
